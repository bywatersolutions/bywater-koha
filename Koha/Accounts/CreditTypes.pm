=head1 NAME

Koha::AccountsCreditTypes - Module representing the enumerated data types for account fees

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Koha::Accounts::CreditTypes;

my $type = Koha::Accounts::CreditTypes::Payment;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The subroutines in this modules act as enumerated data types for the
different credit types in Koha ( i.e. payments, writeoffs, etc. )

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 IsValid

This subroutine takes a given string and returns 1 if
the string matches one of the data types, and 0 if not.

FIXME: Perhaps we should use Class::Inspector instead of hard
coding the subs? It seems like it would be a major trade off
of speed just so we don't update something in two separate places
in the same file.
